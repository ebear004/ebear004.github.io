Hello, my name is Emma Beard. I am currently enrolled as a freshman at the University of California, Riverside. As a Global Studies major, I hope to explore and understand issues that impact the world universally. I hope to use my knowledge to explore the world and ultimately help benefit the world in some capacity. I have always had a keen interest in understanding both how the world works and well as what the global issues the world faces and how to solve the problems. As I get closer to picking which professional field I want to explore, I hope to be a part of journalism. Journalism will allow me to connect and contribute to the betterment of many different people. The type of journalism that interests me deeply is political journalism. I have a strong interest in politics, through political journalism I will be able to further my interest in politics while also improving my writing and comprehension of the world around me.  <br><br>

I am currently employed at Central School District, located in Rancho Cucamonga, based at Cucamonga Middle School. Working as an AVID Tutor, I have had the privilege to meet and encounter many different children, all from different backgrounds. As an AVID Tutor, I work hands-on with middle school students to improve grades and have more understanding they will need for college prep. AVID is a program where students get a better understanding of the college education system and guidance on how to achieve their academic goals. Through the leadership and organizational skills, that I have developed through my academic career, I help students achieve their goals with grace and professionalism. Encountering many different students has allowed me to have a better sense of understanding and grace when working with many different people. I will be able to optimize these skills, in the professional field of journalism. 
<br><br>

Although I do not have much work experience, I do have ample amounts of experience in other ways; including volunteer work and leadership positions. I have been an active participant in the betterment of younger students for many years. During high school, I had the privilege to work with many different students, as Color Guard captain. I developed and implemented training regimens for the entire color guard team. I helped organize daily practices, took attendance, inspected uniforms, as well as inspiring teammates to excel. Being in this leadership role, I led the team to their first appearance in the state finals. Not only that but I also lead a mentorship program at the middle school to inspire the next generation of color guard members. I have also been involved in many volunteer services, which include the High Desert Keepers program, located in the High Desert of California. I volunteered many weekends to clean up litter from protected desert areas. Alongside my peers, I worked diligently and thoroughly picking up trash, despite challenging adverse conditions. These are just a few of the ways that I have personally contributed to the livelihood of younger generations, as well as the environment.
